If forked, do *not* upload to github with your seed phrase. Even if you do it once and delete it in a second, there are web scrapers constantly fishing seed phrases in github, please be careful with your money. This was just a mini-project to try out Anchor's SDK, and maybe can even serve as a "guide-with-example" sort of thing, but not for deployment. *Use this locally, and under your responsibility*.
